# Definitons:
Matrices are 2-dimensional arrays:\
[a b c\
 d e f\
 g h i\
 j k l]
 
 the above matrix has four rows and three columns, so it is a 4 x 3 matrix.

A vector is a matrix with one column and many rows: \
[w\
x\
y\
z]\
So vectors are a subset of matrices. The above vector is a 4 x 1 matrix.\

Notation and terms:
- A_ij refers to the element in the ith row and jth column of matrix A.
- A vector with 'n' rows is referred to as an 'n'-dimensional vector.
- v_i refers to the element in the ith row of the vector.
- In general, all our vectors and matrices will be 1-indexed. Note that for some programming languages, the arrays are 0-indexed.
- Matrices are usually denoted by uppercase names while vectors are lowercase.
- "Scalar" means that an object is a single value, not a vector or matrix.
- R refers to the set of scalar real numbers.
- R^n refers to the set of n-dimensional vectors of real numbers.
