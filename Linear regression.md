#Model representation
- To establish notation for future use, we’ll use x^(i)  to denote the “input” variables (living area in this example), also called input features
and y^(i) to denote the “output” or target variable that we are trying to predict (price). 
- A pair (x^(i) , y^(i))is called a training example, 
and the dataset that we’ll be using to learn—a list of m training examples (x^(i) , y^(i) ); i = 1, . . . , mis called a training set. Note that the superscript “(i)” in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation. We will also use X to denote the space of input values, and Y to denote the space of output values. 
In this example, X = Y = ℝ. 

-To describe the supervised learning problemwe use the function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of y. 
this function h is called a hypothesis.

#Cost function:
-We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average difference  of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.
